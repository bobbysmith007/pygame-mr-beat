Mr. Beat is a Free (libre) Software program that mimics the major features of the Boss Dr. Beat metronome.  (http://www.bosscorp.co.jp/products/en/DB-88/)  You know, that cheesy talking   It has a bunch of different sounds you can use for the beat ticks, including a human voice!  

To use on a GNU/Linux computer: Make sure you have the gtk and pygame modules installed.  These can be installed by opening up a terminal and typing "sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-gtk".  Then, move to the directory and run it with "python mrbeat.py".

I have no idea how to run it on proprietary operating systems because I don't use any of them.  (Windows and Mac)  These OS's take away the freedoms every computer user should have.  See fsf.org to learn more about why.

It is compatible with maemo devices, but make sure you install pygame by typing "sudo gainroot" and then "apt-get install python2.5-pygame".  It doesn't use maemo style or have any packaging.  If anyone would like to do, these would be greatly appreciated.  

Any questions, comments, suggestions, or (if I'm really lucky) patches can be emailed to admin@BernsteinForPresident.com.  If anyone wants to record some better sounds, send them to me and if I like them better, I'll include them.
